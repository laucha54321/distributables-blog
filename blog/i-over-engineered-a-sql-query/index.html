You picture a maniacal laugh, a dramatic reveal. But in engineering, evil is boring. It just sounds like 'best practices' and 'scalability.</blockquote><p>I never meant to build a monster. It started with a straightforward task: compare two messy databases to see if they were syncing correctly. I was just going to write a SQL query. What could possibly go wrong?<p>At work, I'm part of the commercial team doing tech-related tasks—though we have a separate IT department. I chose Python and DuckDB for the job. The databases were messy—different structures, same kind of data, but modeled in completely different ways.<p>The data came from reports, so it was already unnormalized. My job was to match rows from each system and see if they aligned. I got to work: loaded the data, aligned the structures, built a mini data warehouse. So far, so good.<p>But then I started thinking—what if the column names change in the future? I should probably make this flexible. So I added a JSON file to parameterize the column names. That was smart. That was fine.<p><strong>If I had stopped JSONing at that point, everything would have been okay.</strong><p>But I didn't.<p>I realized something: I'd probably need to chain queries together. Some of the structures were repeating, and the logic varied.<p>So I thought, why not take this further? Instead of just executing a list of queries, I could create a JSON file that defines each query type and its parameters.<p>...It felt elegant. It felt scalable. It felt like I was building a powerful engine, not just a simple tool. I started solving problems I didn't have. I went with that idea—and I got it to work. Honestly, I'm pretty proud of it. For a while, it worked surprisingly well.<p>That is, until the next requirement arrived: comparing multiple parameters at once. This broke... pretty much everything. My elegant system only supported simple equality checks between two columns. It was never built for this.<p>And you can probably see where this is going.<p>So I started down the only path that seemed viable: writing a function that could dynamically generate the SQL query I needed, injecting parameters from the JSON.<p>It sounded clever. It sounded scalable. It sounded like I was building a house of cards—impressive to look at, but one slight change would make the whole thing collapse.<p>Luckily, it took too long to build. <strong>The debugging became so painful it forced clarity.</strong> Staring at my mess of errors, I realized; I wasn't a visionary architect. I was an employee with too much time to spare.<p>So I stepped back from the brink. I backed off.<p>I kept the simple JSON config for what it was good for—parameterizing column names—and for the complex comparison, I wrote a dedicated, straightforward SQL query. It was clear, it was robust, and it took me thirty minutes.<p>The lesson wasn't "never abstract." It was: know when to stop. <strong>Thirty minutes. The monster was just a SQL query all along.</strong></article></section></main><footer class="astro-HEYBPPVE leading-[1.75] mt-4 text-sm"><div class="astro-HEYBPPVE">This blog is powered by <a class="unset astro-HEYBPPVE bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r font-bold from-[#00abda] gradient-link hover:after:bg-gradient-to-r hover:after:from-[#00abda] hover:after:to-[#1476ff] text-transparent to-[#1476ff] tracking-wider"href="https://astro.build"target="_blank">Astro</a> with the <a class="unset astro-HEYBPPVE bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r font-bold from-[#00abda] gradient-link hover:after:bg-gradient-to-r hover:after:from-[#00abda] hover:after:to-[#1476ff] text-transparent to-[#1476ff] tracking-wider"href="https://github.com/flexdinesh/blogster"target="_blank">Blogster Newspaper</a></div></footer>
